# LetMePass
Bypasses YouTube's version alert, used for using the latest supported version of the app on iOS 10-14.

# Contributing
To be honest, I don't actually expect anyone to contribute (I donâ€™t really have an idea of any contributions that can even be made). But, if you want to contribute, feel free, it's greatly appreciated! README contributions are also appreciated.

The current version of the code is formatted to the YouTube logo. If you need a more readable version, this commit is the exact same code but formatted normally: [https://github.com/0xilis/LetMePass/blob/b6a0e5e37d6c9acbcba889ddfc8c69939490cbd0/dylib.c](https://github.com/0xilis/LetMePass/blob/b6a0e5e37d6c9acbcba889ddfc8c69939490cbd0/dylib.c). You can just have your contributions formatted normally if you want.

# TODO
Not much. Or really anything I can think about, except more optimizations maybe.

# Compiling
Tweak the `Makefile` to point to a SDK that you have, and compile.
