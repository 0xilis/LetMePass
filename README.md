# LetMePass
Bypasses YouTube's version alert, used for using the latest supported version of the app on iOS 10-14.

# Notice

Due to recent YouTube changes, the current version is currently very unstable, but updates are planned.

# Contributing
To be honest, I don't actually expect anyone to contribute (I donâ€™t really have an idea of any contributions that can even be made). But, if you want to contribute, feel free, it's greatly appreciated! README contributions are also appreciated.

# TODO
Not much. Or really anything I can think about, except more optimizations maybe.

# Compiling
Tweak the `Makefile` to point to a SDK that you have, and compile.

# Licensing
LetMePass is licensed under MIT.
