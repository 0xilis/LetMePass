# LetMePass
Bypasses YouTube's version alert, used for using the latest supported version of the app on iOS 12/13.

# Contributing
Ok; I don't actually expect anyone to contribute TBH (I donâ€™t really have an idea of any contributions that can even be made). But, if you want to contribute, feel free, it's greatly appreciated! README contributions are also appreciated.

# TODO
Not much. Or really anything I can think about, except more optimizations maybe.

# Compiling
Tweak the `Makefile` to point to a SDK that you have, and compile. (And yes, I do know that despite specifying -nostdlib that libSystem still gets linked... it's fine, I'm not even sure if iOS accepts dylibs without libSystem linked, I heard from someone else it doesn't accept executables without it linked so wouldn't surprise me, and that's really only there since Unsigncuts_macOS also had the nostdlib flag).
